    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut potatoes into 1/4" fry shapes. Or fatter if you like "steak fries." I like em skinny and crisp!</li>
        <li>Rinse cut potatoes in a large bowl with lots of cold running water and cover with water by and ice. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large pan (or an electric deep fryer), heat oil over medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>If you have a candy thermometer (recommended), heat until the thermometer registers 325oF (165 C).</li>
        <li>Fry, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are soft and limp, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon or sieve, carefully remove fries from the oil and set aside to drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
